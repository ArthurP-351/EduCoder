2,00:00:02:11,00:00:04:26,00:00:02:15,Student 4,That's the first thing that all the middle school students say when they,,,a,yes
3,00:00:04:26,00:00:05:10,00:00:00:14,Student 3,Right.,,,a,yes
4,00:00:06:04,00:00:07:07,00:00:01:03,Student 3,Like...,,,a,yes
5,00:00:08:04,00:00:10:04,00:00:02:00,Student 1,And then and then all the microphones are just tic tic tic tic tic tic tic.,,,a,yes
6,00:00:11:21,00:00:16:11,00:00:04:20,Teacher,"Yeah, you can just put it face down right where it was. Um, and then if you can say your names into your mic.",,,a,
7,00:00:16:21,00:00:18:03,00:00:01:12,Student 1,My name is Carrie Mollica.,,,a,yes

10,00:00:22:12,00:00:23:28,00:00:01:16,Student 3,Do we have to say that every time we speak?,,,a,yes
11,00:00:24:03,00:00:25:07,00:00:01:04,Student 1,"I don't know, just right now.",,,a,yes
12,00:00:25:07,00:00:36:26,00:00:11:19,Student 2,"I think it's because it should recognize your vocal patterns cuz I know like when I did the research study that threw all them, like it could pick up on each individual student cuz it recognized that that voice was that student even though it didn't listen to it.",,,a,yes
13,00:00:36:26,00:00:38:22,00:00:01:26,Student 3,"We don't have to say our name each time we speak, do we?",,,a,yes
14,00:00:38:25,00:00:39:27,00:00:01:02,Teacher,"No, just the just the first time.",,,a,

18,00:00:44:17,00:00:48:26,00:00:04:09,Student 1,This is... I think also like it'll say like it came from this microphone so it's that person. Yeah.,,,a,yes
19,00:00:50:04,00:00:52:00,00:00:01:26,Student 3,Does anyone know how to say something in a different language?,,,a,yes

28,01:06:21,01:07:08,00:00:00:17,Teacher,Nice.,,,a,
29,01:07:18,01:11:29,00:00:04:11,Student 1,"So I know, I'm not fluent in many languages, but I know bits and pieces of lots of different things.",,,a,yes
30,01:12:08,01:21:23,00:00:09:15,Student 3,"My nephew has been asking a lot of questions about just he loves different countries and he'll even be like, ""what is the second most popular country?"" So I know like the second, third, and fourth of a lot of things.",,,a,yes
31,01:22:15,01:28:22,00:00:06:07,Student 3,"Anyways, we were talking about Dubai and so we were looking at the different languages that are spoken there and then he wanted to know how to say hi.",,,a,yes
32,01:28:24,01:29:21,00:00:00:27,Teacher,Here's the here's the task.,,,a,
33,01:29:21,01:30:11,00:00:00:20,Student 3,In Arabic?,,,a,yes
34,01:30:18,01:34:04,00:00:03:16,Teacher,This task comes from Illustrative Mathematics grade seven. So you were looking at recognition of...,,,a,
35,01:34:10,01:35:10,00:00:01:00,Student 3,Hindi. That's Hindi.,,,a,yes
36,01:35:10,01:36:20,00:00:01:10,Student 1,We were talking about India.,,,a,yes
37,01:36:21,01:38:15,00:00:01:24,Student 3,Okay. So they...,,,a,yes
38,01:38:15,01:38:22,00:00:00:07,Teacher,In these two...,,,a,
39,01:39:13,01:41:09,00:00:01:26,Student 4,You also talk about Dubai another time.,,,a,yes
40,01:41:15,01:46:25,00:00:05:10,Teacher,"In these two diagrams, all triangles weigh the same as each other. All squares weigh the same as each other.",,,a,
41,01:46:25,01:47:19,00:00:00:24,Student 3,She just recorded.,,,a,yes
42,01:48:10,01:59:22,00:00:11:12,Teacher,"So you want to come up at your tables with one thing that must be true, one thing that could be true, and one thing that can't possibly be true about each of these diagrams. And they're up here and I'm going to pass out paper for you as well.",,,a,
43,02:00:13,02:01:28,00:00:01:15,Student 3,"I was like, this is Illustrative math.",,,a,yes
44,02:02:13,02:03:07,00:00:00:24,Student 1,Yeah. That's a...,,,a,yes
45,02:03:13,02:05:07,00:00:01:24,Student 3,Have you ever done the Math Mobiles?,,,a,yes
46,02:06:17,02:07:11,00:00:00:24,Student 3,Huh? Math Mobiles?,,,a,yes
47,02:07:22,02:10:28,00:00:03:06,Student 1,"Yeah, there's like a website where you can have them. I have my kids do it to practice.",,,a,yes
48,02:08:29,02:09:12,00:00:00:13,Student 3,"Yeah, there's a thing.",,,a,yes
49,02:11:03,02:12:12,00:00:01:09,Student 3,And they can like make their own. Yeah.,,,a,yes
50,02:12:15,02:13:00,00:00:00:15,Student 1,Mmm.,,,a,yes
51,02:14:04,02:15:21,00:00:01:17,Student 3,Yeah. I love having my kids do that to practice.,,,a,yes
52,02:15:21,02:22:15,00:00:06:24,Student 1,I can't believe I just said a lot of Namaste and then it's India. I know this.,,,a,yes
53,02:22:15,02:22:29,00:00:00:14,Student 3,Yes.,,,a,yes
54,02:25:06,02:27:21,00:00:02:15,Student 3,I'm gonna turn it off and back on and then we're going to start over.,,,a,yes
55,02:28:10,02:29:26,00:00:01:16,Student 1,My name is Al.,,,a,yes
56,02:30:17,02:32:00,00:00:01:13,Student 4,No.,,,a,yes
57,02:33:10,02:34:23,00:00:01:13,Student 4,What's one thing that must be true?,,,a,yes
58,02:35:16,02:38:29,00:00:03:13,Student 1,The triangle must weigh more than the square.,,,a,yes
59,02:40:05,02:41:22,00:00:01:17,Student 4,Did are the...,,,a,yes
60,02:41:22,02:42:07,00:00:00:15,Student 1,"than one square, right?",,,a,yes
61,02:42:07,02:44:17,00:00:02:10,Student 4,Then we have one triangle must weigh more than one square.,,,a,yes
62,02:44:27,02:52:03,00:00:07:06,Student 4,Only if the point from the triangle to the what we are going to assume is the midpoint is equidistant to the midpoint to the...,,,a,yes
63,02:52:13,02:53:02,00:00:00:19,Student 3,Yeah.,,,a,yes
64,02:53:02,02:54:10,00:00:01:08,Student 4,"Only, yeah we have to assume.",,,a,yes
65,02:54:17,02:55:09,00:00:00:22,Student 3,That must be true.,,,a,yes
66,02:55:12,03:05:07,00:00:09:25,Student 1,"If we if we can assume that it's a if it's a balanced hanger, then the items placed on it, the square has to be weigh less than the triangle.",,,a,yes
67,03:05:25,03:07:11,00:00:01:16,Student 4,"That's our like our conjecture, right?",,,a,yes
68,03:07:18,03:08:08,00:00:00:20,Student 1,"Yes, right.",,,a,yes
69,03:08:14,03:10:04,00:00:01:20,Student 4,Our unproven statement.,,,a,yes
70,03:10:08,03:14:02,00:00:03:24,Student 1,Unproven statement. They didn't they didn't tell us that the diagram was balanced.,,,a,yes
71,03:14:14,03:14:26,00:00:00:12,Student 4,Yeah.,,,a,yes
72,03:15:02,03:16:03,00:00:01:01,Student 1,We're going to assume that.,,,a,yes
73,03:16:15,03:17:01,00:00:00:16,Student 4,Gotcha.,,,a,yes
74,03:18:03,03:19:07,00:00:01:04,Student 1,"in the same way,",,,a,yes
75,03:19:10,03:20:10,00:00:01:00,Teacher,Be clear about your assumptions.,,,a,
76,03:20:15,03:20:25,00:00:00:10,Student 1,Okay.,,,a,yes
77,03:21:04,03:34:04,00:00:13:00,Student 1,"In the same way, a circle has to weigh less than a square or weigh way less than a triangle because the circle is with three additional squares to equal to a triangle if the balance is balanced.",,,a,yes
78,03:34:21,03:45:00,00:00:10:09,Student 4,"Here's a question I have. How do we know that the plane, what way the plane is going? Cuz that can actually be the triangle and the square weighing the same if the plane is this way.",,,a,yes
79,03:45:11,03:45:26,00:00:00:15,Student 1,Right.,,,a,yes
80,03:46:16,03:48:02,00:00:01:16,Student 4,If we're if we're assuming that we're just...,,,a,yes
81,03:48:09,03:48:26,00:00:00:17,Student 1,Say that again?,,,a,yes
82,03:49:10,03:59:22,00:00:10:12,Student 4,"The plane where the um, the line that is adjacent to the... Like you're your viewpoint of it. Like if you're looking at it straight on, they're not balanced if you're looking...",,,a,yes
83,04:00:01,04:01:18,00:00:01:17,Student 3,"Yeah, so we're assuming that it's balanced.",,,a,yes
84,04:01:18,04:18:10,00:00:16:22,Student 1,"So, our the pre-made assumption is that we are look if we make the pre-made assumption that we are looking at it straight on and that they are balanced diagrams, like the hanger itself is balanced, then the triangle weighs more than a square and the triangle weighs more than a circle.",,,a,yes
85,04:18:18,04:22:25,00:00:04:07,Student 4,"if that is a fact, then the triangle and the square will never be equal. They will never be equal.",,,a,yes
86,04:23:18,04:38:00,00:00:14:12,Student 4,"Well, yeah, it depends if we're looking at it through one one dimension, right? Yeah, so like if we make the pre- pre- uh pre-assumption that it's one dimensional, we're looking at it straight on, and the balance the hanger diagrams themselves are balanced, then those thoughts must be true.",,,a,yes
87,04:41:21,04:51:14,00:00:09:23,Student 4,"Yeah, but if we're looking at it in a three-dimensional um in a three-dimensional perspective down the line, then they are equal.",,,a,yes
88,04:51:24,04:52:11,00:00:00:17,Student 3,Right?,,,a,yes
89,04:52:11,04:52:16,00:00:00:05,Student 4,Yeah.,,,a,yes
90,04:52:20,04:56:06,00:00:03:16,Student 3,"Yeah, I mean yeah, if we look at it from a different viewpoint.",,,a,yes
91,04:56:09,04:56:29,00:00:00:20,Student 4,What do you mean?,,,a,yes
92,04:57:04,05:06:29,00:00:09:25,Student 4,"Cuz if I was looking at it from the triangle, looking down at the square, the viewpoint, like this. Okay, so we're seeing it flat. But if I'm looking at it at an angle, then they're the same.",,,a,yes
93,05:07:06,05:12:12,00:00:05:06,Student 1,"Like if you think of perspective, like if somebody's if somebody's standing in front of something and looking at it versus somebody standing further away for",,,a,yes
94,05:12:20,05:17:15,00:00:04:25,Student 4,"So we're looking at it like this right now, right? What if you were looking at it like this? Then they would be the same.",,,a,yes
95,05:17:21,05:18:24,00:00:01:03,Student 3,Mmm hmm.,,,a,yes
96,05:18:28,05:19:14,00:00:00:16,Student 4,Right?,,,a,yes
97,05:19:22,05:20:00,00:00:00:08,Student 1,Yeah.,,,a,yes
98,05:20:06,05:21:00,00:00:00:24,Student 3,I agree with that.,,,a,yes
99,05:24:12,05:47:28,00:00:23:16,Student 1,"So, if we're going with the premise that it's balanced and we're looking at it one-dimensional straightforward, something that has to be, basically what we've said is true, must be true. Something that could be true is that the circle weighs more than the square.",,,a,yes
100,05:48:15,06:02:29,00:00:14:14,Student 1,"Cuz we can make that assumption because there's one circle and three squares. However, we don't have something that shows just the square and circle. So without further investigation, we can't know 100% for sure. We can just assume that it could be true.",,,a,yes
101,06:03:22,06:13:16,00:00:09:24,Student 1,"And then we can also have, like what you're saying, if we um we could say something could be true if we're looking at it from a different viewpoint that they could be equal depending on your viewpoint of things.",,,a,yes
102,06:13:21,06:21:16,00:00:07:25,Student 3,It also could be true. I mean we're assuming that the square has weight. It's possible that the square does not have weight,,,a,yes
103,06:22:04,06:24:26,00:00:02:22,Student 1,and that the triangle and the circle are equal.,,,a,yes
104,06:25:01,06:25:21,00:00:00:20,Student 3,Yeah.,,,a,yes
105,06:25:21,06:26:07,00:00:00:16,Student 1,It could be.,,,a,yes
106,06:26:11,06:27:06,00:00:00:25,Student 4,get the triangle...,,,a,yes
107,06:27:11,06:28:22,00:00:01:11,Student 3,"Yeah. Yeah, that's true.",,,a,yes
108,06:31:06,06:31:29,00:00:00:23,Student 4,That would that could be possible.,,,a,yes
109,06:32:15,06:41:22,00:00:09:07,Student 1,Um something that cannot be true? Two squares cannot be equal to one square because it tells us that they all weigh the same.,,,a,yes
110,06:42:25,06:47:27,00:00:05:02,Student 3,"Well, unless two squares weigh nothing and one square weighs nothing.",,,a,yes
111,06:47:27,06:53:23,00:00:05:26,Student 1,So then we could say two triangles cannot weigh one triangle because we know the triangle has weight.,,,a,yes
112,06:54:21,06:56:07,00:00:01:16,Student 3,Unless the triangles are zero.,,,a,yes
113,06:56:16,07:00:07,00:00:03:21,Student 1,"Well, if the triangle was zero, then the squares would have to be negative.",,,a,yes
114,07:01:14,07:10:14,00:00:09:00,Student 1,So in some at some uh in some way the triangle has weight because it unless it's like I was saying where it's...,,,a,yes
115,07:10:14,07:13:00,00:00:02:16,Student 4,"Yeah, cuz that line right there could be like perpendicular.",,,a,yes
116,07:13:08,07:22:15,00:00:09:07,Student 4,"Right? The intersection for the box on the left, if you're viewing it as the intersection is perpendicular, right? Then they would be",,,a,yes
117,07:23:08,07:25:10,00:00:02:02,Student 4,"that's when they would be in the same plane, right?",,,a,yes
118,07:25:21,07:26:02,00:00:00:11,Student 1,Yeah.,,,a,yes
119,07:26:05,07:27:07,00:00:01:02,Teacher,Maybe giving you a hint on this.,,,a,
120,07:27:14,07:28:02,00:00:00:18,Student 4,"You just, yeah.",,,a,yes
121,07:30:17,07:53:05,00:00:22:18,Student 1,"Really, we need we would need more and like I, like you were saying, it's from Illustrative Math. I know this is from like a seventh grade, eighth grade level, so like I know where they're coming at with things. But like if you're coming at it from the viewpoint of we're all different levels, we don't know what level, like we really need some more information on things. Like they need to tell us that, you know, it's one-dimensional or two multi-dimensional or whatever, so we can know what we're looking at.",,,a,yes
122,07:53:20,08:06:17,00:00:12:27,Student 1,"Cuz otherwise everything is a possible truth because if we don't know those defining characteristics, then we can't we can't have a for sure statement or something that is true and is not true.",,,a,yes
123,08:06:24,08:07:23,00:00:00:29,Student 3,Mmm hmm.,,,a,yes
124,08:08:14,08:11:29,00:00:03:15,Student 3,In seventh grade are they are thinking about 3D planes already?,,,a,yes
125,08:12:12,08:13:21,00:00:01:09,Student 1,"No, see, that's the thing.",,,a,yes
126,08:13:25,08:27:04,00:00:13:09,Student 1,"So in seventh grade and eighth grade, we're not thinking we are not thinking multi- multiple planes. We are thinking this is for introducing expressions and equations. And so they're literally just thinking of it as it's a balance, it's a hanger.",,,a,yes
127,08:27:12,08:28:00,00:00:00:18,Student 3,Right. Okay.,,,a,yes
128,08:28:10,08:37:29,00:00:09:19,Student 1,"So, yeah, cuz like before they introduced these ones, they show a picture of a set of socks, and one set of socks is balanced and the other set of socks, one sock has something in it to make it unbalanced.",,,a,yes
129,08:38:15,08:47:11,00:00:08:26,Student 1,"So, like, from my viewpoint having taught those lessons, I'm thinking of it straightforward, balanced hangers, whereas somebody who teaches higher level math... Yeah, exactly.",,,a,yes
