31,2:18:24,2:30:26,0:12:02,Student 3,"Oh, so like, could it be that one thing that must be true? If we put one triangle on one side and one triangle, another triangle on the other side, it would be level.",,,a,yes,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,6,1,0,0

46,3:23:09,3:28:29,0:05:20,Student 4,"Although, is this distance greater than this distance?",,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0
47,3:29:12,3:36:23,0:07:11,Student 1,"Oh, so one thing that could be true? So could there be more bar here and that's adding to the weight?",,,a,yes,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,0
48,3:37:11,3:38:00,0:00:19,Student 1,Or weight.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
49,3:39:03,3:40:08,0:01:05,Student 1,Or Okay.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
50,3:43:03,3:46:27,0:03:24,Student 2,So does the length of the bar influence the distribution?,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
51,3:47:24,3:50:24,0:03:00,Student 3,Are they drawn to scale?,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
52,3:52:03,3:54:21,0:02:18,Student 1,I feel like we have to assume that it is.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,3,1,0,0
53,3:55:00,3:56:08,0:01:08,Student 2,We know.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
54,3:59:22,4:02:11,0:02:19,Student 4,"So, three and three quarters.",,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
55,4:07:29,4:09:21,0:01:22,Student 4,It's about the same. Okay.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
56,4:11:15,4:14:26,0:03:11,Student 1,That That is a very supported piece of the puzzle to establish.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
57,4:22:15,4:25:28,0:03:13,Student 2,So it cannot possibly be true that the square weighs more than the triangle.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,1,2,0,1,0
58,4:26:14,4:26:27,0:00:13,Student 1,Right.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
59,4:29:19,4:32:15,0:02:26,Student 3,And I don't think it's possible for them to be the same.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,1,1,0
60,4:32:15,4:32:22,0:00:07,Student 2,Yeah.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
61,4:34:04,4:37:25,0:03:21,Student 2,It could be true that a square and a circle are the same.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
62,4:38:21,4:39:15,0:00:24,Student 3,Mmmhmm.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
63,4:40:02,4:41:22,0:01:20,Student 1,The circle cannot... trying to fill in the...,,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
64,4:41:22,4:45:22,0:04:00,Student 3,"Yeah, there's no mention of circles up there, so, yeah, I think that could be true.",,,a,yes,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
65,4:46:01,4:47:24,0:01:23,Student 4,There's no circle at all in this one.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
66,4:47:24,4:48:07,0:00:13,Student 1,Mhm.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
67,4:51:24,4:52:26,0:01:02,Student 1,be equal parts.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
68,4:52:26,4:53:05,0:00:09,Student 2,Yeah.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
69,4:53:29,5:10:20,0:16:21,Student 3,"Like it's an It could be true that the circle weighs the same as a square, then it could be possible for the triangle to weigh the same amount as four squares or four circles, I mean four circles.",,,a,yes,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,1,3,0,2,1
70,5:11:00,5:14:26,0:03:26,Student 1,The triangle could then weigh the same as four squares and a triangle to equal to four circles.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
71,5:21:26,5:28:29,0:07:03,Student 4,"So, since we don't know what the circle weighs, it could be true that a circle weighs the same as a square.",,,a,yes,0,1,0,5,5,0,0,1,4,1,0,1
72,5:34:04,5:41:19,0:07:15,Student 3,"To cla- it's been a while since I've worked with hanger diagrams. There is no element of subtraction like this circle is being a negative value, right?",,,a,yes,0,1,0,2,1,0,2,3,2,0,0,2
73,5:42:09,5:50:06,0:07:27,Student 1,"I was gonna say that the triangle is definitely more than three squares, because it's three squares and then something else, but what if the circle represents",,,a,yes,0,1,1,6,6,1,1,3,3,1,1,1
74,5:50:23,5:54:14,0:03:21,Student 3,something negative and then that's not necessarily true. I don't know.,,,a,yes,0,0,1,2,2,0,0,2,1,0,0,1
75,5:54:14,6:04:22,0:10:08,Student 1,"I think with hanger diagrams though cuz this is based on weight, it has to be all positive. I don't think that it could be like pushing up. Yeah. I think it has to be all positive since it's a hanger since it's like weight based.",,,a,yes,0,4,0,11,9,0,0,6,7,0,0,2
76,6:04:22,6:05:29,0:01:07,Student 4,Can something have a negative weight?,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
77,6:06:17,6:06:26,0:00:09,Student 1,No.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
78,6:07:07,6:10:17,0:03:10,Student 3,Right? No. Unless there's another force up here that's,,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,2,0,0,0
79,6:11:15,6:13:09,0:01:24,Student 4,Unless it's a helium balloon.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
80,6:16:11,6:18:14,0:02:03,Student 4,"I've never, ever done a hanger diagram.",,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
81,6:19:28,6:21:25,0:01:27,Student 4,"It's beyond my grade level, so...",,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
82,6:25:00,6:33:04,0:08:04,Student 2,"Yeah, I'm trying to think this is lower than mine but I'm trying to think of what this would be the warm up for. Like, what are they learning that's right? Like measurement?",,,a,yes,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,3,7,2,0,0
83,6:34:00,6:46:27,0:12:27,Student 3,"I could see it connecting measurements for fifth grade. But like, I think, like, I don't know if it would be this wordy, but like, I I've seen Kinder also work with like balancing objects.",,,a,yes,0,0,0,5,5,0,1,1,3,1,1,0
84,6:47:20,6:56:28,0:09:08,Student 1,"So this would be like inequality related. Like you could write an inequality based on this, and this would be an equivalency, so some type of equation would be generated from this.",,,a,yes,0,1,0,5,5,0,0,0,3,2,0,0
85,7:01:21,7:06:06,0:04:15,Student 4,So the weight of a triangle is greater than the weight of a square.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
86,7:06:06,7:14:02,0:07:26,Student 1,And it's like are they going to be for variable representation? Right? So are they going to eventually we could replace with X and Y and Z potentially.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,3,4,3,0,1
87,7:14:26,7:19:22,0:04:26,Student 4,Then is it as simple for the what cannot possibly be true is just to flip that around and say that it,,,a,yes,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,5,1,1,0
88,7:19:22,7:22:25,0:03:03,Student 1,Right. Like we know that,,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0
89,7:23:00,7:25:21,0:02:21,Student 4,the square cannot weigh more than the triangle.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
90,7:25:21,7:26:07,0:00:16,Student 1,Uh-huh.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
91,7:27:07,7:28:10,0:01:03,Student 4,I can give you anything.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,0,0
92,7:33:19,7:33:29,0:00:10,Student 1,So must not.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
93,7:34:11,7:36:20,0:02:09,Student 4,But the could be. What would the could be be? square,,,a,yes,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
94,7:37:16,7:41:25,0:04:09,Student 2,The could be was what we were saying with like a circle could be the same as a square.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,3,3,0,2,0,2,2,0,0
95,7:42:15,7:46:23,0:04:08,Student 1,"Or a circle could be greater than a square, they see? So what's what's the could be for this one?",,,a,yes,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,4,1,0,0
96,7:47:04,7:47:11,0:00:07,Student 4,Oh.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
97,7:48:19,7:51:14,0:02:25,Student 2,"I think they just go together, no? I don't know.",,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
98,7:51:27,7:54:21,0:02:24,Student 4,"Oh, I was I was reading, yeah, I was reading it a different way.",,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,3,0,1,0,0,0
99,7:58:24,8:04:22,0:05:28,Student 2,Well it could be that the triangle weighs twice as much as the square.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0
100,8:04:22,8:05:13,0:00:21,Student 4,Okay.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
101,8:05:13,8:05:27,0:00:14,Student 1,Mmmhmm.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
102,8:06:21,8:12:21,0:06:00,Student 3,Would it the angle be affected by like twice versus one minute.,,,a,yes,0,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
103,8:14:14,8:18:23,0:04:09,Student 1,"I think in general with the balance beams that kind of applies, yes.",,,a,yes,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
104,8:19:10,8:19:19,0:00:09,Student 3,Very.,,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
105,8:20:13,8:29:21,0:09:08,Student 1,"Yeah, so there was like some kind of association with angle and and um, the weight, the uh net weight.",,,a,yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
