1,00:00:00:26,00:01:06:11,1:05:15,Student 4,So is that the first thing that all the middle school students say when I right? Yeah. And then and then all the high school students say yep.,,,a,yes
2,0:11:06,0:18:03,0:06:27,Student 1,"I got excited because the questions like put up on the board were what I've been, that's been my like situation scenario whatever, the whole day.",,,a,yes
3,0:18:21,0:19:01,0:00:10,Student 3,"Oh, nice.",,,a,yes
4,0:19:01,0:22:21,0:03:20,Student 1,"So I was like, finally, someone's saying the question I've been asking.",,,a,yes
5,0:22:21,0:23:09,0:00:18,Student 3,Yay.,,,a,yes
6,0:24:29,0:26:07,0:01:08,Teacher,Do you all say your name into your Not yet.,,,a,
7,0:26:07,0:26:15,0:00:08,Student 1,Not yet.,,,a,yes
8,0:27:27,0:29:10,0:01:13,Student 1,Do we need to turn on anything or no?,,,a,yes
9,0:31:00,0:31:18,0:00:18,Teacher,We're on.,,,a,
10,0:32:21,0:34:21,0:02:00,Student 2,Ashley Shinda Donitis.,,,a,yes
11,0:35:10,0:35:28,0:00:18,Student 4,Michael Barrett.,,,a,yes
12,0:36:26,0:37:25,0:01:00,Student 3,Tracey Shipman.,,,a,yes
13,0:40:15,0:41:22,0:01:07,Student 4,There's so many Michaels. You got to,,,a,yes
14,0:42:15,0:43:24,0:01:09,Student 2,Ashley Burch.,,,a,yes
15,0:45:10,0:46:13,0:01:03,Student 4,I just went with the first one.,,,a,yes
16,0:46:25,0:47:11,0:00:16,Student 1,I appreciate it.,,,a,yes
17,0:48:15,0:50:23,0:02:08,Student 1,I'm I'm so curious what math we're going to do.,,,a,yes
18,0:52:13,0:55:28,0:03:15,Student 1,It's always fun trying to find like the happy medium that everyone feels like they can,,,a,yes
19,0:56:06,1:05:27,0:09:21,Student 3,"I know, because sometimes when you're so like, um Okay. Yeah, in lower grades like elementary school, it's hard to identify. I'm like, well I guess how do you teach the",,,a,yes
20,1:06:21,1:07:05,0:00:14,Student 1,What do you teach?,,,a,yes
21,1:07:22,1:18:14,0:10:22,Student 3,"I teach fifth grade math. Okay. Well, fifth grade, like all multiple subjects, but yeah, I don't know how I forgot everything that I learned like calculus. I don't know what that is anymore.",,,a,yes
22,1:19:15,1:27:26,0:08:11,Student 2,"I teach high school math and I still if a kid came with an AP Calc tutoring question, I'd be like, well let me like look through that real quick. Let me reteach myself for a second.",,,a,yes
23,1:29:07,1:36:23,0:07:16,Teacher,"All right, here's the, here's the task. This task comes from Illustrative Mathematics grade seven. Some of you were looking with recognition at the finger diagram.",,,a,
24,1:37:02,1:37:21,0:00:19,Teacher,"Um, but yeah.",,,a,
25,1:38:09,1:59:29,0:21:20,Teacher,"So, all, for those of you who are not familiar though, in these two diagrams, all triangles weigh the same as each other, all squares weigh the same as each other. Um so you want to come up at your tables with one thing that must be true, one thing that could be true, and one thing that can't possibly be true about each of these diagrams. And they're up here and I'm going to pass out a paper for you as well.",,,a,
26,2:03:22,2:03:27,0:00:05,Student 4,Okay.,,,a,yes
27,2:07:11,2:08:26,0:01:15,Student 3,Gravity works different.,,,a,yes
28,2:10:20,2:15:02,0:04:12,Student 4,"Must be true, could be true, cannot possibly be true.",,,a,yes
29,2:16:03,2:16:29,0:00:26,Student 4,Never done this before.,,,a,yes
30,2:17:15,2:17:29,0:00:14,Student 1,Actually,,,a,yes
31,2:18:24,2:30:26,0:12:02,Student 3,"Oh, so like, could it be that one thing that must be true? If we put one triangle on one side and one triangle, another triangle on the other side, it would be level.",,,a,yes
32,2:32:00,2:35:26,0:03:26,Student 1,"That must be true, that a triangle equals a triangle, or a triangle equals a triangle.",,,a,yes
33,2:36:26,2:42:06,0:05:10,Student 4,We need to do three for this and three for this. Right? I think.,,,a,yes
34,2:43:21,2:51:25,0:08:04,Student 3,"Oh, so this diagram has to have something that's true and something that could be true, and something that, okay, for this specific I can't make up my own.",,,a,yes
35,2:52:13,2:57:24,0:05:11,Student 1,"Oh, see, I would think that it's I think what you're saying.",,,a,yes
36,2:57:24,2:58:24,0:01:00,Student 2,"Oh, yeah.",,,a,yes
37,2:58:24,3:00:20,0:01:26,Student 3,"Oh, because here we could say that",,,a,yes
38,3:00:20,3:05:27,0:05:07,Student 2,a triangle must be heavier than a square.,,,a,yes
39,3:05:27,3:06:06,0:00:09,Student 3,Yeah.,,,a,yes
40,3:06:17,3:11:27,0:05:10,Student 1,But it could still be true on the right side. I think they do work together in that way.,,,a,yes
41,3:11:27,3:12:12,0:00:15,Student 2,Yeah. Okay.,,,a,yes
42,3:12:12,3:12:20,0:00:08,Student 1,Yep.,,,a,yes
43,3:15:04,3:18:24,0:03:20,Student 3,Very simpler simply we know that a triangle does not equal a square.,,,a,yes
44,3:19:07,3:20:00,0:00:23,Student 1,"Right, that's a must.",,,a,yes
45,3:21:05,3:23:09,0:02:04,Student 3,"Yeah, you can just write it down we can keep track of it.",,,a,yes
46,3:23:09,3:28:29,0:05:20,Student 4,"Although, is this distance greater than this distance?",,,a,yes
47,3:29:12,3:36:23,0:07:11,Student 1,"Oh, so one thing that could be true? So could there be more bar here and that's adding to the weight?",,,a,yes
48,3:37:11,3:38:00,0:00:19,Student 1,Or weight.,,,a,yes
49,3:39:03,3:40:08,0:01:05,Student 1,Or Okay.,,,a,yes
50,3:43:03,3:46:27,0:03:24,Student 2,So does the length of the bar influence the distribution?,,,a,yes
51,3:47:24,3:50:24,0:03:00,Student 3,Are they drawn to scale?,,,a,yes
52,3:52:03,3:54:21,0:02:18,Student 1,I feel like we have to assume that it is.,,,a,yes
53,3:55:00,3:56:08,0:01:08,Student 2,We know.,,,a,yes
54,3:59:22,4:02:11,0:02:19,Student 4,"So, three and three quarters.",,,a,yes
55,4:07:29,4:09:21,0:01:22,Student 4,It's about the same. Okay.,,,a,yes
56,4:11:15,4:14:26,0:03:11,Student 1,That That is a very supported piece of the puzzle to establish.,,,a,yes
57,4:22:15,4:25:28,0:03:13,Student 2,So it cannot possibly be true that the square weighs more than the triangle.,,,a,yes
58,4:26:14,4:26:27,0:00:13,Student 1,Right.,,,a,yes
59,4:29:19,4:32:15,0:02:26,Student 3,And I don't think it's possible for them to be the same.,,,a,yes
60,4:32:15,4:32:22,0:00:07,Student 2,Yeah.,,,a,yes
61,4:34:04,4:37:25,0:03:21,Student 2,It could be true that a square and a circle are the same.,,,a,yes
62,4:38:21,4:39:15,0:00:24,Student 3,Mmmhmm.,,,a,yes
63,4:40:02,4:41:22,0:01:20,Student 1,The circle cannot... trying to fill in the...,,,a,yes
64,4:41:22,4:45:22,0:04:00,Student 3,"Yeah, there's no mention of circles up there, so, yeah, I think that could be true.",,,a,yes
65,4:46:01,4:47:24,0:01:23,Student 4,There's no circle at all in this one.,,,a,yes
66,4:47:24,4:48:07,0:00:13,Student 1,Mhm.,,,a,yes
67,4:51:24,4:52:26,0:01:02,Student 1,be equal parts.,,,a,yes
68,4:52:26,4:53:05,0:00:09,Student 2,Yeah.,,,a,yes
69,4:53:29,5:10:20,0:16:21,Student 3,"Like it's an It could be true that the circle weighs the same as a square, then it could be possible for the triangle to weigh the same amount as four squares or four circles, I mean four circles.",,,a,yes
70,5:11:00,5:14:26,0:03:26,Student 1,The triangle could then weigh the same as four squares and a triangle to equal to four circles.,,,a,yes
71,5:21:26,5:28:29,0:07:03,Student 4,"So, since we don't know what the circle weighs, it could be true that a circle weighs the same as a square.",,,a,yes
72,5:34:04,5:41:19,0:07:15,Student 3,"To cla- it's been a while since I've worked with hanger diagrams. There is no element of subtraction like this circle is being a negative value, right?",,,a,yes
73,5:42:09,5:50:06,0:07:27,Student 1,"I was gonna say that the triangle is definitely more than three squares, because it's three squares and then something else, but what if the circle represents",,,a,yes
74,5:50:23,5:54:14,0:03:21,Student 3,something negative and then that's not necessarily true. I don't know.,,,a,yes
75,5:54:14,6:04:22,0:10:08,Student 1,"I think with hanger diagrams though cuz this is based on weight, it has to be all positive. I don't think that it could be like pushing up. Yeah. I think it has to be all positive since it's a hanger since it's like weight based.",,,a,yes
76,6:04:22,6:05:29,0:01:07,Student 4,Can something have a negative weight?,,,a,yes
77,6:06:17,6:06:26,0:00:09,Student 1,No.,,,a,yes
78,6:07:07,6:10:17,0:03:10,Student 3,Right? No. Unless there's another force up here that's,,,a,yes
79,6:11:15,6:13:09,0:01:24,Student 4,Unless it's a helium balloon.,,,a,yes
80,6:16:11,6:18:14,0:02:03,Student 4,"I've never, ever done a hanger diagram.",,,a,yes
81,6:19:28,6:21:25,0:01:27,Student 4,"It's beyond my grade level, so...",,,a,yes
82,6:25:00,6:33:04,0:08:04,Student 2,"Yeah, I'm trying to think this is lower than mine but I'm trying to think of what this would be the warm up for. Like, what are they learning that's right? Like measurement?",,,a,yes
83,6:34:00,6:46:27,0:12:27,Student 3,"I could see it connecting measurements for fifth grade. But like, I think, like, I don't know if it would be this wordy, but like, I I've seen Kinder also work with like balancing objects.",,,a,yes
84,6:47:20,6:56:28,0:09:08,Student 1,"So this would be like inequality related. Like you could write an inequality based on this, and this would be an equivalency, so some type of equation would be generated from this.",,,a,yes
85,7:01:21,7:06:06,0:04:15,Student 4,So the weight of a triangle is greater than the weight of a square.,,,a,yes
86,7:06:06,7:14:02,0:07:26,Student 1,And it's like are they going to be for variable representation? Right? So are they going to eventually we could replace with X and Y and Z potentially.,,,a,yes
87,7:14:26,7:19:22,0:04:26,Student 4,Then is it as simple for the what cannot possibly be true is just to flip that around and say that it,,,a,yes
88,7:19:22,7:22:25,0:03:03,Student 1,Right. Like we know that,,,a,yes
89,7:23:00,7:25:21,0:02:21,Student 4,the square cannot weigh more than the triangle.,,,a,yes
90,7:25:21,7:26:07,0:00:16,Student 1,Uh-huh.,,,a,yes
91,7:27:07,7:28:10,0:01:03,Student 4,I can give you anything.,,,a,yes
92,7:33:19,7:33:29,0:00:10,Student 1,So must not.,,,a,yes
93,7:34:11,7:36:20,0:02:09,Student 4,But the could be. What would the could be be? square,,,a,yes
94,7:37:16,7:41:25,0:04:09,Student 2,The could be was what we were saying with like a circle could be the same as a square.,,,a,yes
95,7:42:15,7:46:23,0:04:08,Student 1,"Or a circle could be greater than a square, they see? So what's what's the could be for this one?",,,a,yes
96,7:47:04,7:47:11,0:00:07,Student 4,Oh.,,,a,yes
97,7:48:19,7:51:14,0:02:25,Student 2,"I think they just go together, no? I don't know.",,,a,yes
98,7:51:27,7:54:21,0:02:24,Student 4,"Oh, I was I was reading, yeah, I was reading it a different way.",,,a,yes
99,7:58:24,8:04:22,0:05:28,Student 2,Well it could be that the triangle weighs twice as much as the square.,,,a,yes
100,8:04:22,8:05:13,0:00:21,Student 4,Okay.,,,a,yes
101,8:05:13,8:05:27,0:00:14,Student 1,Mmmhmm.,,,a,yes
102,8:06:21,8:12:21,0:06:00,Student 3,Would it the angle be affected by like twice versus one minute.,,,a,yes
103,8:14:14,8:18:23,0:04:09,Student 1,"I think in general with the balance beams that kind of applies, yes.",,,a,yes
104,8:19:10,8:19:19,0:00:09,Student 3,Very.,,,a,yes
105,8:20:13,8:29:21,0:09:08,Student 1,"Yeah, so there was like some kind of association with angle and and um, the weight, the uh net weight.",,,a,yes
