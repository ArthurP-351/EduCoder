0,"Initial Strategies || In this note, students are sharing their initial strategies for finding the area of the circle. One student counts full squares just in the circle, one student counts the area of the square that circumscribes the circle, and one student multiplies the diameter times 3 (estimate for pi). || This evidence shows early thinking toward the purpose of the lesson by showing understanding of the concept of area. One student also begins to reason about the relationship between the features of the circle (diameter in this case) and the area of the circle. ",Strategy: Underestimating by counting full squares only || The student is describing their strategy of counting the amount of whole unit squares in the circle and excluding any partial squares enclosed in the circle. This same student later states that the circle contains half squares and critiques another student's strategy because it may not account for the partial squares. || The student has an understanding that to estimate the area would be to estimate the number of squares that can fit inside the circle. The student is also showing and developing an understanding about accuracy in estimating by acknowledging that a more accurate strategy would account for the partial squares and not just the full squares.,"1 || The students are discussing the different ways they estimated the area of the circle and in particular considering a student who did 8*8 (which was the diameter) and the other student who did 8*pi. || This shows that students have familiarity with pi and that it is related to the circle and how we calculate characteristics of the circle's size.  This also shows that students understand that diameter (which is double the radius rather than square of the radius) is key to understanding the size of the circle.  Furthermore, the students do understand the concept of area as the number of squares inside the circle and get that partial squares are not the same as full squarse.",1 || The student counted each whole box as one within the circle. They did not count partial squares || The student understands area as the number of boxes fully contained inside the circle.,"relationship between pi and measure of circle || Students are trying to figure out how to calculate the area of the circle.  || Although they haven't figured out that the area is pi times radius squared, they have a sense that there's a relationship between pi and one of the measurements of a circle. They are misapplying it to area. ","1 || They're sharing their differing strategies for estimating the number of unit squares in the circle. One estimate is counting only whole squares inside and another counts all the unit squares within the rectangle encasing the circle. || This is a great first step in the lesson that shows that students are thinking about over and under estimating the area of the circle, and how to account for partial areas.","34 (counting inner shape of full squares) || This student estimated a conservative lower bound for the number of unit squares it would take to cover the circle by only counting the full squares in the circle. However, the inner shape composed by full squares the student talks about, that excludes the outside ring of incomplete squares, corresponds to only 32 squares. Any decision to include almost complete squares would add at least 4 or 8 squares, so I think that the 34 is due to an error in counting. || Not much, as they are not yet relating the radius squares or radio to the area of the circle nor using an outside square and estimating the circle as 3/4 of the total of the area of the square.","1 || Students are sharing different strategies for estimating the area of a circle. Student 2 counts the full unit squares inside the circle, ignoring partial squares. Student 3 estimates the area by counting across the circle and diagonally. Student 1 estimates by measuring the diameter and multiplying it by 3, showing some connection to the idea of π. They also discuss and record each other’s estimates and strategies. || This evidence shows that students actively engage in estimation strategies and begin to reason about the relationship between linear measurements (like diameter) and area. Although their methods are still informal and not entirely accurate, they make meaningful attempts to approximate the location of a circle, setting the foundation for understanding that the area relates to the square of the radius and π. Their willingness to compare strategies suggests developing mathematical reasoning and collaboration skills aligned to the lesson's goals.",1 || The student is sharing their strategy. || The student understands that the squares need to be complete to count as one. I wonder if the student is able to piece half of squares together and count those as one as well?,1 || They are figuring out how to find the area through counting squares on the inside of the circle. || They understand that area is defined by a space inside of the shape.,Full Squares || Student 2 counted full squares and didn't include partial squares near the circumference || This kid understands that area is the amount of square units covering a flat surface but I'm not sure yet if they understand their estimate was an underestimate,Strategy: Underestimating by counting full squares only || The student is describing their strategy of counting the amount of whole unit squares in the circle and excluding any partial squares enclosed in the circle.

",Full Squares || Student 2 counted full squares and didn't include partial squares near the circumference 
1,"Radius Squares * Pi || Here, students are discovering that 3 radius squares is less than the area of the circle and 4 radius squares is more than the area of the circle. They come to the understanding that the area is closest to pi radius squares.  || Through estimation, students understand that the circle's area is between 3 and 4 radius squares, eventually landing on pi. Students have made sense of the relationship between the radius squares and the area and can meet the first lesson goal through repeated reasoning in the next activity. ","Strategy 2: Overestimating using the area of a square circumscribing the circle || The student is explaining that they counted the height of the circle and the diagonal of the circle, and then multiplied these units together to get their estimate of 64 units. || This tells me that the student understands that there is a relationship between the dimensions of the circle (in this case the diameter) and the area of the circle. The student appears to be using the area of a square formula, either intentionally or unintentionally, because they do not identify this in their explanation. However, their estimate ends up producing the area of the square that would circumscribe the circle. 

This student does not discuss unit squares and their response does not indicate that they are sure if this estimate is accurate or reasonable. ","2 || The students are discussing how many (radius) squares they need to cover the area and deciding whether its 3 or 4.  They know 3 is not enough and 4 is too many (has excess) || This shows that they understand the area is the total space inside so 3 is not quite enough and 4 is too many. They are getting closer to using pi as the the number of (radius) squares they need to cover the circle. They are also using 16, which is the size of the (radius) square and multiplication.",2 || All students came up with an estimate.  || All students understood enough about area to make an estimate.,"3 radius squares = area of circle || students are deciding between using four radius squares and three.  || This is telilng me that they have a sense that four radius squares would be too many. They are trying to figure out how to get rid of the ""excess"" ","2 || They're discussing a strategy that incorporates pi, multiplying by pi because they know that pi relates to circles somehow. || They're trying to tie in their prior knowledge of the number pi, since they know it relates to circles somehow. This is great because it can help prime students to relate the estimate of area to pi, but it also seems like they're trying to randomly or formulaically apply pi without much sense making at this point. ","24 (diameter times 3) || The student used prior knowledge on how to calculate the perimeter of a circle (diameter times pi), rather than using unit squares to calculate the area of a circle. The student did not recognize that that formula is not appropriate for this task that requires estimating coverage (area) rather than surrounding (perimeter). The student thinks his estimate is the closest because he compares 24 against the multiplication of 8 times 3.14.  || Though they talk about Pi, they are just brining knowledge from prior classes rather than relating the radius squares or radio to the area of the circle nor using an outside square and estimating the circle as 3/4 of the total of the area of the square.","2 || Students are discussing how to calculate the area of a circle by relating it to the number of radius squares needed. They debate whether to multiply 16 by 3, 4, or 3.14, showing an evolving understanding that the number of radius squares needed to fill a circle relates to π (approximately 3.14). They suggest strategies like multiplying the area of a radius square by π and attempting to figure out how to deal with partial squares to get an accurate total. They also reference earlier visual models and animations to support their reasoning. || The students are making important connections between the radius, the concept of squaring the radius, and multiplying by π to find the area. Their conversation shows that they recognize that three radius squares are not quite enough and that about 3.14 radius squares are needed, moving toward a conceptual understanding of why the formula for the area of a circle is

2,Cutting Radius Squares || Students are figuring out how to cut radius squares to equal the area of the circle. They are talking about cutting each radius square to fit the circle and keeping the excess.  || Students understand that they will need a bit more than 3 radius squares to fill the area of the circle - 3.14 radius squares to be exact. They know that they can rearrange the excess parts of the 3 radius squares and add a bit from a 4th one to equal the circle's area.,"Strategy 3: Using the circumference formula  || The student  (student 1) starts by clarifying what pi and saying it's like 3, and then describes the strategy they used to get their estimate, which was to count the diameter and then multiplied by 3, which they then revised after a Student 2 paraphrased them and said that student 1 multiplied 8 by pi.  || This tells me that the student understands or is guessing that pi is relevant when measuring a circle's area, potentially due to their prior interaction with the circumference formula. This also shows me that the student understands how to find the diameter of a circle and also understands that the diameter of the circle will likely be relevant or helpful in calculating the area of the full circle. 

The fact that the estimate is far too low to be reasonable shows me that they may struggle with checking their answer for accuracy or may be too focused on finding a formula rather than checking for reasonability. It also could potentially show a lower understanding of the overall concept of what area means. This student's strategy does not discuss the concept of unit squares at all and does not show that they understand which part of the circle they are being asked to measure.",3 || Students are discussing how to multiply 16 by 3.14. || Students are using the size of the radius square and multiplying it by their estimate of pi (3.14).
