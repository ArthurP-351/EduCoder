Math Claim	Makes a factual mathematical statement or conjecture.	"qua, quarta inter quartile range, IQR, is found by calculating difference between the third quartile and the first quartile it is the range of the middle 50 percent of the data after [unintelligible] the inter-quartile range for the temperature data from 1975, that wait, we're supposed to do a first so by looking at your box plots from problems 80, 8-46 and 8-47, determine which year, wait guys, do we not do a because it has 8-46 and don't do that"	158_179	"They're like, 3.5 would be half so it's like [unintelligible] 3.5 divided by 2 we get the answer."	296_57	"7 times 4 is... Come on, green don't fail me now. 28."	296_73	"They're like, 3.5 would be half so it's like [unintelligible] 3.5 divided by 2 we get the answer."	296_57	I may do 1.75 times 4and see if that works.	296_69	"But, like... I feel like... You did 12,500 divided by 350, right?"	307_420
Explain (Action)	Reports on the steps of a mathematical procedure.	So first off I figured out how many minutes it'd take for one lap	267_324	I divided her time by 60 and then I  divided Rebecca's time by 60	267_348	"Alight so, first off, me and you, we did number 1, we do number 2. All right, so first off I figured out how many minutes it'd take to run one lap by multiplying 8... First off, for Amy, by multiplying their minutes per mile by 3. Did you write that down? Write that down."	267_354	Copy me. First of all...	267_343	That's what we're doing first.	267_451	"So, don't I just need to times it by..."	307_553
Explain (Reason)	Explains why something is justified or true.	"Yeah three fourths divided by eight, divided by eight because three four is going to eight."	156_217	Because out of the 100 he was about to let 20 away. So it's 20%	298_19	"I think it's X plus two to the power of two, like this. Because X, if it was three plus two, then it'd be five and five to the power two is 25."	308_218	It wouldn't work. It would only work for nine and figure one and figure two.	308_239	"No, we're not supposed to do the questions first. We're supposed to do the table and then we find figure 100."	308_248	"No. I mean, in all of these, we're supposed to show how figure 100 would be like."	308_392
Agree	Student expresses agreement with idea	"That's right. 6 times 4 and then times 3, 72"	242_144	"Yes it does. 6 30. 1 fifth. It has the same ratio, it doesn't mean it's the same number but it has the same ratio"	246_224	I am probably gonna get that but I am not sure 'cause I am at 1.7 right now. Yeah I got 1.75.	296_68	"Yeah, because we did another problem just like this."	308_185	He doesn't want the chicken at Sweet Hearts. Don't you agree that Sweet Heart's pumpkin chicken is better than Quickly's?	33_254	"No, show me and I'll see if I agree. If I don't, then, yeah, it's just too bad. But if I do agree, [unintelligible]. Sometimes I don't. What are you doing?"	337_43
Disagree	Student expresses disagreement with idea	"No, maybe you graphed it wrong."	399_555	"Here, wait. No, this one is incorrect."	210_178	"Oh, no, they would never lap because Rebecca's time has to be over double Amy's time..."	267_472	Same. And nobody agreed with me because somebody has to maybe change my answer.	340_20	"this is, no it's not oh wait yes it is, my bad [unintelligible]"	362_195	"I kind of agree, and I don't agree. We do."	66_83
Compare	Student compares similarities or differences between ideas	"But we agree... I did it way different than you guys did. I did 60 minus 12, divided by 2."	191_31	"Yeah, he's right. It's one-fifth, it could be one-fifth. So... 20%"	298_23	"Yea, it's the same answer but different work."	364_292	"No, I got this."	4_429	"Because it's the same, wait, the zero goes in the front. [unintelligible]"	37_224	I got like 1/5th.	371_151
Add On	Adds on to a mathematical idea (offers additional reasons or rationale rather than just expressing agreement or support for an idea)	"Student 1: So we knew that 3.5 went into 7 twice so then we divided 3.5 by 2...  
Student 2: To see how much it would be with 4 people."	" 296_150, 296_151"	"Student 1:We think this because 1.5 is...        
Student 2: Goes into 6 four times. "	"296_119
296_120"	"Okay. Yes, that makes sense. 1 second. You're right. That makes sense. She's right. Because then if you add if you add up the big chicken plus the medium chicken and the big chicken plus the small one, and then you do minus the one."	309_283	Yeah you're right.	92_36	"Oh, yeah. That's what I. No, no. You're right. It's 1.25. [Student 3.309:male], we did it wrong. We did it wrong. [Student 3.309:male]."	309_446	"it'll be 0.066 because a hundred minus 90 equals 10 and then you have to do 90, you have to add another zero"	320_171
Question (General)	Asks a general question	Is it OK if I didn't draw in the lines?	15_251	Wait. Do you have an equation for this one?	397_65	"Do you think we should try the graph? [unintelligible]. I mean, we're supposed to have multiple guesses. So, let's just write that as 1. Do we need to do that thing? I don't wanna."	397_86						
Question (Specific)	Asks a specific question	"um, is that still the base? would this be the height?"	15_218	Shouldn't we get negative X minus 1?	397_93	"so, let's see, I'm gonna see, um, okay the height, I mean the base is, the base is from, okay let's, this is, so let's say from 2 to 2, that is 4 and 3.5. so, base is 3.5. and height is basically this and the height is 3, right? is it?"	149_227	Yeah. See this. Right? Okay. So what if we put...	397_146	Only number two? Yes.	397_279	"Good for you. Wait, do we not do it here?"	399_24
Revoice	Student rephrases/completes teammate's statement	"yeah, it's a mixed number, how you make a mixed number into an improper fraction?"	149_119	I said it was gonna be a decimal and they said a whole number	216_313	"Okay, so you said that... Just like we did the shed. The shed we did where it was... We used this scale, right? One meter equal to three centimeters. And so you were saying that maybe it's the exact same as this, and maybe it's seven meters is equal to three times seven. So seven meters is equal to twenty-one centimeters. Is that what you were saying?"	225_128	I seriously thought that's what you said.	235_13	You said mark on the map where Rebecca and Amy. And then I leaned over and you stopped me from touching your map.	235_233	"but then what are we supposed to be answering, there's no option for [unintelligible] the first answer you said"	239_4
Apology	Student apologizes	I'm sorry I'm failing at this	159_324	oh I'm sorry that was ugly	168_80	We're just adding them together because it's every load so that was my bad sorry	359_290	"Oh, my bad. We made a mistake. It says [Unknown Person 2.48] because I didn't have my iPad. That's two zeros."	48_498	What is it again? My bad.	485_344	Yeah you should be sorry.	517_409
Next Step	Student suggests the next step for the group to take	Make an estimate so shall we split it up into 3 columns to put all these 3?	296_36	"I guess we should all take a piece of scratch paper and do the problem, see what we get."	296_58	"OK now we can write the explanation of: show how you would distribute... We could do an illustration or diagram. And then we can write an explanation 'cause it should include diagrams, words and numbers."	296_124	I'm doing the hybrid and explaining it. And they are doing the minivan next.	34_53	Then we said the measurements were three shmallows.	340_110	Can we move on to the next?	345_41
Redirect	Redirecting other participant to get on task	"shh guys, guys, focus focus [Student 4.320:male] try to do, try to do like a representation for the math"	320_466	Can we focus on the math? And why are you still touching it?	424_458	We don't have time to chit chat.	246_286	Stop.	424_469	"Come on, man. It's okay to joke in life. You know, sometimes when you do math, you gotta be chill. You can't always be too focused on your work. You're gonna stress yourself out, man. Focus, but don't focus so much that you lose yourself. What is this thing? Is it a microphone?"	425_44	Give me a second. Sorry. I'm in a state of focus.	474_190
Help	Offering nonmathematical help	"student 1: Nine. [Student 2], you help me.
Student 2: Okay.
Student 1: You can do the bubble.  "	"251_400, 251_401, 251_402"	"To let me help you draw it. Here, let me."	337_149	"Okay, I'm going to help you out when I'm done with this part. That thing is watching you do this. That thing is looking at you doing it. I have to do my work."	337_212	"Yeah, I know, but she can help us get something. She can be like what do you do here? And then what do you do there? And then you do this. And then you. Can you do this?"	284_218	"Times eight. Times four minus five, which is seven Y minus three Y equals four hundred forty over two, which is ten Y... No, not ten Y. Four Y. Equals two twenty. And then... Y equals fifty-five. Oh, that wasn't too hard. Okay. Y. Wait, what? Hm? I'm just like doing the math, and I got eleven Y. It doesn't help me figure out Y."	286_195	"M'kay. Well, that helped me. Hopefully we can go really fast on this, guys."	286_315
Help (Math)	Offering mathematical help	"Would you like me to help you? Okay. So here, I'll set it up for you. Okay, [Student 4.313:male]? Would you like me to set it up for you? No, no, no. I'll set up the division for you. Okay? One. So that'd be [unintelligible]. And then just figure it out from there."	313_298	"Student 1: It's going to be below the X axis, and it's. [Student 4.274:male], you gotta help me.
Student 2: What?
Student 1: So it's, is this wider and below the X axis?     
Student 2: These will be both below the X axis. Practically the same thing as the ones above, but just reflected across the x axis.       "	274_169-274_172	"Okay, what part do you need help with?"	278_196	Okay. What [unintelligible]? she's helpless.	280_157	"Wait, what's our second attempt? We need to write down more of our attempts. Guys, guys. [Student 3.280:male]. [Student 2.280:female]. Help. I'm not writing down anything."	280_170	"Wait, can we get help from [Teacher 1.284:female]? Can your [Teacher 1.284:female] help us or not? Is [Teacher 1.284:female] allowed to help us? Or is this a loner task?"	284_182
