    "gradeLevel": "Grade: 7, Unit 6: Expressions, Equations, and Inequalities, Lesson 7: Reasoning about Solving Equations",
    "lessonGoal": "The goal of this lesson is for students to understand that we can generally approach equations of the form px + q = r by subtracting q from each side and dividing each side by p (or multiplying by 1/p). Students only work with examples where p, q, and r are specific numbers, not represented by letters. This is accomplished by considering what can be done to a hanger to keep it balanced. Students are solving equations in this lesson in a different way than they did in the previous lessons. They are reasoning about things one could “do” to hangers while keeping them balanced alongside an equation that represents a hanger, so they are thinking about “doing” things to each side of an equation, rather than simply thinking “what value would make this equation true” or reasoning with situations or diagrams.",
